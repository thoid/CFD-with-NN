# CFD-with-NN
Optimization of Air Conditionner placement using CFD simulations with Neural Network

# Introduction
The goal is to have access to the best placement of Air Conditioner in a bedroom in University House Aobayama.
To know the best configuration, you need to do a lot of CFD simulations, so it takes a lot of time, the goal is to train a NN model on a small database, then use this model to find the best placement.
To access the best configuration, I can directly have access to the PMV index though the CFD simulations
